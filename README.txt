This is a hexadoku solver

To run this program you call the following line: 
ruby main.rb path_to_board

I have tried to structure the files so HexadokuGame contains all files 
needed to create a workable game with its front existing in hexadokuBoard.rb.
Everything is done so it should be possible to switch the solver algorithm for
a GUI and have a playable game.

In example_boards there are some files I have used to test this application
